# This is a README file detailing how results can be obtained in each of the project for the FYS-STK course at UiO. 

Project 2: 
This repository contains several Python scripts for generating plots related to different datasets and tasks. Each of the plotting functions is located in the respective script mentioned below. To obtain the results, follow the instructions below:

Script List

breast_cancer_plotting.py: This script contains plotting functions related to the breast cancer dataset.
franke_plotting.py: This script contains plotting functions related to the Franke dataset.
gate_plotting.py: This script contains plotting functions related to the gate dataset.
logistic_regression_plotting.py: This script contains plotting functions related to logistic regression.
Usage

To obtain the results and visualize the plots, follow these steps:
1. Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed. You can typically install dependencies using a package manager like pip.
For example:

```bash
   pip install matplotlib numpy scikit-learn
```
2. Open a terminal or command prompt in the directory containing the scripts.

3. To generate the plots related to a specific dataset or task, run the corresponding script using the Python interpreter. 
For example:
```bash
   python breast_cancer_plotting.py
```

Replace breast_cancer_plotting.py with the name of the script you want to execute (e.g., franke_plotting.py, gate_plotting.py, or logistic_regression_plotting.py).

4. The script will execute the plotting functions and generate visualizations based on the data or task it is designed for. The generated plots may be displayed on your screen or saved to a file, depending on the script's configuration.  
5. You can review the generated plots and use them for analysis or presentation as needed.
Please refer to the specific script's documentation and comments for more details on the plots generated and any customization options available.  

Enjoy exploring the results and visualizations provided by these plotting functions!
